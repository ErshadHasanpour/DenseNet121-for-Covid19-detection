# DenseNet121 for Covid19 detection
In this code, we tried to implement a Densenet-121 for detection of covid-19 in CT images based on this [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34337432/). We exactly took steps based on the paper and got an accuracy of 93.23%. Just like the paper, we used data normalization and augmentation technics to enhance the performance of the classifier. Then we utilized a DenseNet-121 to conduct the classification task, based on transfer learning. The corresponding confusion matrix is demonstrated below.
